# Mercura
## The Epidemiological Assistent
Mercura is an interactive chatbot that allows doctors to 
quickly report irregularities within their group of patients.
This way enabling faster detection of disease outbreaks.

The mercura prototype was developed during the [hack4health 2018](https://www.hack4health.de/) in Osnabr√ºck. It is developed 
with Python and DialogFlow.
